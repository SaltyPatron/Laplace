# Laplace

Content-addressable geometric-attestation substrate; a construction (not training) path
from it to runnable transformer models; and a graph-walk inference engine that closes a
self-improvement loop. Omni-modal (text, chess, code, AI models — per-modality tier
ladders under one identity law) and omni-glottal (every language meshes at the ILI
concept hub). SQL/C# orchestrate; native C/C++/SPI does the math. It replaces the two
primitives modern ML is built on — GEMM similarity and nearest-neighbor search in a
trained embedding — with graph search over a Glicko-weighted evidence graph and a
deterministic, lossless, content-addressed identity system.

## The invention — three layers, three keys

Every fact from every source — WordNet, ConceptNet, a chess game, a user prompt, an AI
model's weights — reduces to one **attestation** 5-tuple
`(subject, relation_type, object, source, outcome/score)`.

- **CONTENT** (`entities`/`physicalities`), keyed by BLAKE3 content hash. Identical
  content = identical id, at every tier, from every source — cross-source merging is a
  hash collision, never an entity-resolution pass. "Pawn E2→E4" is ONE entity no matter
  who played it.
- **EVIDENCE** (`attestations`): one row per assertion, with source/context/outcome.
  Provenance is never mashed — Magnus's E2E4 and yours are distinct provenanced rows.
- **CONSENSUS** (`consensus`), keyed by `(subject, type, object)`, folding evidence into
  literal Glicko-2 (`rating`, `rd`, `volatility`, `witness_count`). `eff_mu = rating −
  2·rd` is the conservative estimate everything ranks by. The fold input is a continuous
  score; trust enters as the opponent RD — trust is inside the rating math. The fold plus
  read-side RD/eff_mu IS the noise model: no operator-invented floors, caps, or top-k
  anywhere. Top-k exists only as a query LIMIT.

Geometry (`physicalities.coord`/`trajectory`) is a lossless, deterministic,
content-addressed identity and serialization system — tier-0 codepoints pinned on S³ by
UCA order; composed entities store exactly-invertible ordered constituent sequences
(`ContentRoundtrip` rebuilds a document's original bytes from its id alone); `mantissa.c`
bit-packs ids/scores/counts through the same PointZM columns. Geometry is identity and
reconstruction, NOT semantics. The semantics live in the Glicko-weighted attestation
graph: **a colony of spider webs — pull one strand and Glicko-2 tells you what tugs back
and how hard.** That web IS a weighted graph Laplacian; tension = certainty (witnessing
shrinks RD and tightens the strand).

## Tiers and modalities

Tiers are a FLOOR, not identity: 0 codepoint (the Rosetta stone), 1 grapheme, 2 word,
3 sentence, 4 document. Same content = same id at every tier; tier is never mixed into
the hash ("Fine" as a one-word reply IS the sentence IS the word — one id). Each
modality gets its own ladder under the same law: text rides codepoints; the chess board
is its own modality (squares/pieces → resolved moves → positions → games); code and AI
checkpoints ride their containers. Tree-sitter's job is narrow: unpack container
formats, then hand off.

## Decomposers — the witness boundary

Verified inventory: 24 decomposer classes in `Laplace.Decomposers` (Atomic2020, CILI,
Code, ConceptNet, FrameNet, ISO, MapNet, Model, OMW, OpenSubtitles, PropBank, Recipe,
Repo, SemLink, Stack, Tabular, Tatoeba, TinyCodes, UD, Unicode, VerbNet, Wiktionary,
WordFrameNet, WordNet) plus 3 in `Laplace.Chess` (ChessPgn, ChessAnalyze,
ChessOpenings). All are pure content → `SubstrateChange` record streams with ZERO inline
SQL; the pipeline spine (`IngestBatchPipeline` working-set mode →
`ConsensusAccumulatingWriter` → `NpgsqlWorkingSetApply`, bracketed by `IngestRunner`)
does batching/dedup/fold/COPY.

**Ingestion is RECORDING, not processing.** Two layers everywhere:
witnessed = what a source literally asserts, transcribed verbatim;
calculated = anything derived by interpreting the witnessed layer — deferred, versioned,
evictable, under its own analysis source/trust. Calc outranks observation only where
both claim the same fact; trust binds to source/method; their divergence is itself
signal. Attest each fact ONCE, at the tier, identity, and provenance the source asserts
it (a corpus asserts a sentence's language at the sentence root, not per word).

### The AI-model decomposer — a decomposer like every other decomposer

WordNet's decomposer reads XML rows and emits attestations. The model decomposer reads
tensor rows/columns and emits attestations. Nothing else is special about it.

- A checkpoint is a WITNESS on equal epistemic footing with WordNet (trust class
  AiModelProbe — one voice among many, outranked by design). Its tensors assert
  token→token couplings: **A attenuates to B with this intensity** — a row/column
  lookup. The raw intensity is the outcome signal: coupling → `laplace_score_fp` → the
  Glicko-2 fold, under the governed relation type of its plane (ATTENDS, OV_RELATES,
  COMPLETES_TO, CONTINUES_TO, SIMILAR_TO). "Dog attenuates to noun" becomes a rated,
  provenanced, walkable consensus row.
- It also attests occurrence: `(token, APPEARS_IN, layer/head coordinate)`. Circuit
  coordinates are shared content across models (plane anchor + layer/head scalars;
  scalar ids follow the text content law) — the model NEVER enters an id; it is the
  attestation source. Cross-model agreement is a hash collision at one consensus cell.
- **The circuit is the game (chess-trajectory parity).** Every circuit (layer/head
  coordinate) deposits ONE testimony-packed linestring on its coordinate entity —
  its entire relational assertion, every token with its score, exactly as a game's
  trajectory carries its whole move sequence. Anatomy queries read one row per
  circuit per model; pair knowledge folds in consensus; provenance is never mashed
  and evidence never balloons. The decoder ring (`HeadClassifier` → ENCODES) names
  circuits against the rated web ("L10.H3 ENCODES capital-of"), and
  `model_jitter_catalog()` convicts artifacts by failed corroboration (one witness,
  wide RD) — mechanistic interpretability as indexed queries.
- **One-time scrape; compute at ingest; store meaning only.** Stream the safetensors 1D
  float buffer record by record; native math (MKL/Eigen/Spectra kernels) converts
  records into token→token attestations. Raw floats are consumed and discarded — never
  stored, never deferred to query time. If the knowledge isn't in the substrate after
  ingest, the ingest didn't do its job.
- **Aggregate, don't balloon:** pair evidence collapses across circuits at plane grain
  (observation_count / sum_score via the aggregated-attestation builders); content
  addressing merges across models at consensus. One evidence row per (token, plane,
  token) per model.
- Tokens are the same content entities the text lanes mint. Hidden dims, learned bases,
  tensors-as-arrays are packaging — they appear nowhere. No truncation of what the
  source asserts: near-zero couplings are draws the fold rates; nothing else decides.
- Recorder/analyzer split, as in chess: recorder = witnessed structure (bytes, recipe
  scalars, vocab, merges, TOKEN_MAPS_TO, coordinates); analyzer = the calculated scrape,
  versioned and evictable. The decoder ring (`HeadClassifier` → ENCODES) names circuits
  in the web's own vocabulary — the model's anatomy made legible.

## Chess — the proving domain

Chess is the proving domain because its ground truth is objectively checkable.
`outcome ∈ {Loss=0, Draw=1, Win=2}` is bit-identical to chess's `PlyOutcome` on purpose —
the same math that rates chess players rates every epistemic claim. Every ply emits BOTH
edge kinds: provenance edges (subject/context game-specific — who/when/which game) and
aggregating edges (deduped move/position subjects carrying the game outcome into the
fold — how good/how common). A move played in 10M games is stored once; every play is a
preserved witness; the rating engine runs on the board. Record = PGN tokens verbatim
(SAN, clocks, eval tokens, comments, NAGs); calculate = replay/positions/geometry/motifs
under the versioned ChessAnalysis source. The board geometry ladder (square/piece S³
anchors → resolved-move transitions → position geometry → mantissa-packed game
trajectories) is specified in `.scratchpad/11`.

## The mesh — omni-glottal by construction

Every node id is content-addressed from a canonical key, so two decomposers producing
the same key produce the SAME node — the collision IS the mesh. The master hub is the
synset ≡ ILI node (addressed by its ILI string): CILI mints it; WordNet, OMW's
multilingual lemmas, ConceptNet's /wn/ suffixes, Wiktionary sense links, SemLink,
PredicateMatrix, MapNet, WordFrameNet all converge on it. Companion hubs: VerbNet class,
FrameNet frame/LU, PropBank roleset, WordNet sense, and the word-surface node.
surface → lemma → sense → ILI concept → frame/class/roleset → roles is a fully attested,
multi-witnessed, calibrated factorization of meaning — each arrow a typed,
Glicko-weighted, provenanced edge family. Cross-lingual transfer is free because ILI is
the address. Relations are governed in `engine/manifest/relation_types.toml` — verified
right now: 189 relations, 13 salience bands, manifest and generated
`highway_manifest.h` in parity. Codegen assigns highway bits alphabetically: adding a
relation renumbers bits and owes a reseed — regenerate, never backfill.

## The SQL surface and the extension

`laplace_substrate` carries the read/serve side natively: 27 SQL function families
(analysis, cascade, consensus, contrast, converse, corpus, fold, generation, geometry,
glicko2, highway, identity, inference, ingest, inspect, lexical, link, mu, ops,
readback, realize, recall, relation, structural, taxonomy, trajectory, variant) plus
native C for the hot paths: `recall.c` (intent-routed serving), `generate_walk.c`
(batched beam frontier, ranked natively by `relation_rank × eff_mu`), `astar_path.c`,
`trajectory_generate.c` (n-gram descent with consensus fallback), `consensus_fold_*`,
`highway_mask.c` (perfcache-backed bit ops), `perfcache.c` (mmap'd blobs, postmaster
prewarm). `SELECT * FROM api('<substring>')` is the schema's self-introspection catalog
— check it before assuming a helper doesn't exist.

## Foundry — Mold-A-Model (export)

Consensus + geometry are MOLDED into a runnable transformer, deterministically, no
gradient descent. "Pour" is EXPORT vocabulary exclusively. Every substrate primitive has
a transformer slot: consensus adjacency → weights/topology (edge weight = rank ×
(eff_mu − neutral) × exp(−κ·rd) × witness-saturation — the Glicko-complete signed
weight, live in `consensus_adjacency`); relation types + salience bands → attention
heads; the normalized-Laplacian eigenmap of the consensus graph (the colony at rest,
`eigenmaps.cpp`) → the constructed embedding, hidden dim = spectral rank; S³ anchors →
Procrustes canonical orientation; hilbert index → positional encoding; trajectories →
sequence position; voronoi cells → MoE routing; the completion operator → lm_head, with
the conditional floor (rank-d factorization of log P(y|x) from attested continuations,
POS-corrected) as the calibrated base and correction layers gated to improve it
monotonically. Scoped pours (filter attestations by source/context → re-fold → pour)
are the custom-molding product mechanism. Export spine: `engine/synthesis`
(gguf_writer, tensor_decompose, qk kernels) + `engine/dynamics` (eigenmaps,
gram_schmidt, procrustes) + `FoundryCommands`. Every exported weight decomposes back to
its witnesses. The one open research question (doc 09): does consensus × geometry ×
trajectory ROUTE as well as trained attention at depth.

## Inference — the Gödel/OODA engine

The walk IS the forward pass, run as indexed graph search with MORE information per
step than a trained dot product: the full Glicko tuple, relation salience, highway
bits, geometry, source trust, provenance down to witnesses — explainability is a
literal returned field (`eff_mu`, `witnesses`), not a metaphor. A prompt is ingested as
content, so attention over it is unbounded retrieval — no context window. And it
CLOSES: prompts and responses deposit as witnesses (UserPrompt/Response sources),
feedback confirms/refutes triples through one lane (`FeedbackContent` → writer spine →
immediate fold), and the next walk reads the updated consensus. **Evaluation IS
ingestion.** Self-signals are outranked by design (Response/UserFeedback/AiModelProbe
trust classes) — one voice among many. This closed self-improving loop is what makes it
a mind and not a lookup.

## Binding engineering laws

- Content-hash identity is exact. Tier is a floor, never mixed into the hash.
  Coord/hilbert equality is not identity for tier>0 (centroids commute); order-sensitive
  judgments need trajectory metrics.
- Ids are NEVER constructed outside the system: `canonical_id()`, `word_id()`,
  `relation_type_id()`, `consensus_id()` resolve through the native hash.
- All math in C/C++/SPI. C# and SQL orchestrate. One implementation per fact —
  duplication needs a documented reason.
- The ingest pipeline is a SEQUENCE: unpack → records → client-side dedup across the
  working set → client-side Glicko accumulation → one bulk tier descent → pure COPY of
  proven-novel rows. The right algorithm at the wrong point is a violation.
- KNN comparison points must reach the planner as bound parameters; EXPLAIN before
  trusting an index. An expensive STABLE function in a filter runs per row; a
  MATERIALIZED CTE fences.
- Verify against live data. Diagnose root cause at the source. Profile before
  optimizing (VTune is installed). Run long commands bare — no output filters over live
  progress.

## Build / deploy / seed

Two toolchains, not interchangeable: `Justfile` + root CMake = Linux/CI. The Windows
workflow is `scripts/win/*.cmd`. **If a script covers the task, use the script.**

| Task | Entry point |
|------|-------------|
| Full clean rebuild | `rebuild-all.cmd` |
| Engine / extensions | `build-engine.cmd [--reconfigure]` / `build-extensions.cmd` then `install-extensions.cmd` |
| ASAN engine | `build-engine-asan.cmd` |
| All tests (the gate) | `test-all.cmd` — log at `%LAPLACE_EXT_BUILD%\test-all.log` |
| dotnet tests | `test-app.cmd [project-substring]` |
| native ctest / pg_regress | `test-engine.cmd` / `regress.cmd` |
| Seed | `db-reset.cmd`, `seed-foundation.cmd`, `seed-step.cmd <source>` (trust `:verify_step`), `seed-everything.cmd` |
| CLI | `cli.cmd` (never `dotnet run` — the ingest mutex matches the command line) |
| Locks / stuck processes | `locks.cmd` (`locks.ps1 -Kill`) |
| Status / deploy checks | `status.cmd`, `verify-deploy.cmd`, `verify-toolchain.cmd` |
| PG recovery / tuning | `fix-postgres.cmd`, `recover-pgdata.cmd`, `tune-pg.cmd`, `tune-laplace.cmd` |

- **Never invoke `scripts/win/*.cmd` through PowerShell** (confirmed pwsh .cmd-launch
  regression). Use Bash: `cmd //c "scripts\\win\\seed-step.cmd wordnet"`.
- Script logs land in `D:\Data\Output\<script>.log`. `scripts/win/env.cmd` is the
  toolchain source of truth (`dotnet` stays bare).
- After ANY engine rebuild, run build-extensions + install-extensions (static-lib
  import: extension freshness ≠ engine freshness). Extension SQL changes need
  `build-extensions.cmd --reconfigure` (configure-time version hash).
- Health check: `senses(word_id('dog')) > 0`. The text-literal form `senses('dog')`
  always returns 0.
- One ingest at a time. Never kill `Laplace.Cli`/psql/backends you didn't start —
  unexplained COPY = active ingest, stand down. Long processes launch detached
  (Start-Process, log to `D:\Data\Output`).
- MSB3027 ⇒ output tree poisoned ⇒ clean rebuild. Never edit a `.cmd` while it is
  executing. Recycle PG backends only between stages.
- perfcache: two mmap'd deterministic blobs required at runtime
  (`laplace_t0_perfcache.bin`, `laplace_highway_perfcache.bin`); PG side gated on the
  `laplace_substrate.perfcache_path` GUC.
- DB access: `psql -h localhost -U postgres -d laplace` (password `postgres`);
  `SET search_path = laplace, public;` first.

## Layout

13 projects (verified): libs `Laplace.Core` / `Laplace.Substrate` /
`Laplace.Decomposers` / `Laplace.Chess`; deployables `Laplace.Cli` /
`Laplace.Endpoints.OpenAICompat` / `Laplace.Chess.Uci` / `Laplace.Migrations`;
5 test projects. xunit suites share process-global native state — fixtures must never
`CodepointPerfcache.Unload()`.
